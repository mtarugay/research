README - research
This is a compilation of programs with research and past codes I have been messing around with.

books.py
One of my earlier attempts with creating classes for object-oriented programming. It is a set of books under the book class.

cat.py
Another attempt of creating classes this time utilizing class inheritance/subclasses to add more attributes and different methods.

productlist.py
Class usage is again seen here, using separate classes for each product to display.

tortol.py
Although not as advanced in turtle usage, this uses turtle to display multiple circles that will either orbit or create an 8 loop. (The different loops are placed as comment. Uncomment the other while loop and set the other one as a comment.)

turtle userinput.py
Another use of turtle to create a loop of orbiting circles, this time it asks for user input beforehand to set the forward and rotation speed.


TICKET SYSTEM
ticketing system.py and tickets.py
An assessment for a help desk prototype. tickets.py contains the ticket class itself, while ticketing system.py holds the actual interface and lets users create, reopen, and respond to tickets and be able to see all tickets and statistics.
